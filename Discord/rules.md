**Be Respectful**
Treat others with kindness and respect. Disagreements are okay, but personal attacks, harassment, and hate speech will not be tolerated.

**No Trolling or Spamming**
Avoid trolling, spamming, or any disruptive behavior that can negatively impact the experience of others in the server.

**Stay on Topic**
Keep discussions relevant to the server's purpose. Off-topic conversations should be taken to appropriate channels or private messages.

**No NSFW Content**
Ensure that all content shared is appropriate for all audiences. This includes text, images, links, and any other form of media.

**Use Appropriate Channels**
Utilize the designated channels for specific topics. For example, use a dedicated channel for general chat, and support requests.

**No Advertising Without Permission**
Refrain from promoting external products, services, or other Discord servers without explicit permission from the server administrators.

**Respect Privacy**
Do not share personal information about yourself or others without consent. Respect the privacy of fellow members.

**Be Mindful of Language**
Use language that is inclusive and avoids offensive or discriminatory terms. Keep in mind that people from diverse backgrounds may be part of the community.

**Seek Help Responsibly**
If you need support, feel free to ask, but remember that the community is not a substitute for professional help. Encourage others to seek professional assistance for serious issues.

**Be patient**
Not everyone can be around 24/7, and support can be exhausting even on a good day. Please, do not DM or ping people who have not already engaged in conversation with you! None of us enjoy getting random “help me” messages.
